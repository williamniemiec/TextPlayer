Cyberpunk 2077 has now entered its "final stretch of development," and developer CD Projekt Red appears confident there will be no further major delays.
CD Projekt Red's CFO Piotr Nielubowicz made these comments during a video recapping the first-half of the developer's fiscal year, stating "When we meet again in this format, Cyberpunk 2077 will have already been released."

These videos are released at the end of each quarter, meaning the next video would be scheduled for December. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, this would mean Cyberpunk 2077 is still on track to be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 19, 2020.

While a delay of a few weeks could still happen, it appears it won't be long until Cyberpunk 2077 is in the hands of many around the world and, according to CD Projekt Red, it has "entered its final stretch of development, marked by very intensive work."

We recently got our hands-on Cyberpunk 2077, and we said it "feels like the spiritual successor to Warren Spectorâ€™s legendary original, Hall-of-Fame-inducted Deus Ex, and I cannot personally pay it a higher compliment than that. It just might somehow live up to the years of hype."
